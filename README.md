# Overview

This is my GIS Mapping learning project. My intent was to learn and hone my skills in programming as a software engineer and to further improve my skills in my career. To do that, I decided to learn about the basics of GIS Mapping and add that into my set of skills.

<!-- {Provide a description the map software that you wrote. Describe how to use your software.  Describe the source of the data that you used.} -->

The purpose in writing the program is to create 20 markers in Rexburg, Idaho. 5 markers for BYUI buildings, 5 for student housing, 5 for local stores, and 5 for food places.

# Development Environment

- Python 3.9 64-bit
- Visual Studio Code
- Git / GitHub

Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

Python is a programming language with objects, modules, threads, and automatic memory management. Python is a very simple language, and has very straightforward syntax that programmers fall in love with including me.
